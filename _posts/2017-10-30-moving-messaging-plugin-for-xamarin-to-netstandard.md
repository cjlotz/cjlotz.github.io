Following in [James Montemagno's footsteps](https://montemagno.com/plugins-for-xamarin-go-dotnet-standard), I've now published a pre-release version of the [Messaging Plugin](https://github.com/cjlotz/Xamarin.Plugins) that has been reworked to support .NET Standard to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xam.Plugins.Messaging).  Besides .NET Standard support, some other minor fixes/enhancements were also made ([Change Log](https://github.com/cjlotz/Xamarin.Plugins/blob/master/Messaging/ChangeLog.md)).  

I hope to publish the release version of the plugin towards the end of the week.
