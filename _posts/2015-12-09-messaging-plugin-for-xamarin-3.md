I've just published an update to the [Messaging Plugin](https://github.com/cjlotz/Xamarin.Plugins) for Xamarin that includes support for the Windows Universal Platform (thanks to [James Montemagno](https://twitter.com/JamesMontemagno)). The update introduces a breaking change whereby the default namespace for the plugin changes to `Plugin.Messaging` to align with the naming strategy for Xamarin plugins proposed by James Montemagno in his latest round of Xamarin plugin updates. Due to this breaking change, the version of the plugin has been bumped to v3.0.0.
