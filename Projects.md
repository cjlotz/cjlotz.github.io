The last 8-9 years I've been heading up a development team responsible for building the [On Key Enterprise Asset Management System (EAMS)](http://www.on-key.com/).  We are currently creating the next generation of On Key that will run off .NET Core with a HTML 5/JS web font-end.  

## Mobile

I love using [Xamarin](https://xamarin.com) and [MvvmCross](https://mvvmcross.com/) to develop high quality, cross-platform mobile solutions using C#.  

Some mobile apps and NuGet packages that I created/spearheaded:
* [HSSE Logger](https://hsse.pragmaworld.net/) - The **H**ealth **S**afety **S**ecurity **E**nvironment Logger allows the quick and easy reporting of incidents, near misses and potential incidents

* [On Key Work Manager](http://www.on-key.com/functionality/mobile-work-manager-app) - The On Key Work Manager app lets you track the actions and locations of your maintenance staff and contractors to verify that their work is completed on the right asset in line with safety standards, best practice and service levels.  Features of the app include:
  * Full offline support
  * Location tracking
  * Voice recording
  * Camera integration
  * Document attachments (Photos, Job-cards etc.)
  * Electronic signatures
  * Fillable PDF forms
  * Barcode scanning ...

* [Messaging Plugin](https://github.com/cjlotz/Xamarin.Plugins) - Xamarin plugin that makes it possible to make a phone call, send a sms or send an e-mail using the default messaging applications on the different mobile platforms. 

  Install from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xam.Plugins.Messaging/) or from the [Xamarin Component Store](https://components.xamarin.com/view/Xam.Plugins.Messaging)
