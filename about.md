Hi there!  My name is Carel Lotz.  I'm a Christian, husband, father-of-three and work as a Software Architect/Developer.  I love coding and using technology to write high quality code using agile development methodologies and techniques.  I especially enjoy coding within the Object-Oriented paradigm and I have a keen interest in OO design principles and patterns. 

I live in the beautiful Cape Town, South Africa.  Besides coding I enjoy endurance sports like mountain biking and love playing guitar/piano/singing in our church band.

## Work Experience

The [Projects page](/Projects) contains some examples of recent projects that we've successfully delivered/currently involved in.  I currently specialize mostly in the Microsoft .NET technology stack, but started off doing C/C++ development and even did a bit of Smalltalk development early on in my career.

You can view more about my work experience from my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carellotz/).
